 ## About this Project

The idea of the App is:

_"Find other devs in a certain distance that use certain technologies"._
 
## Why?
This project is part of my portfolio, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!

## Installers
If you want to test the App in the Production mode, the installers are listed below
- NodeJs [Link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for backend.
- ReactJs [Link](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) for frontend.
- ReactNative [Link](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) for mobile
- Due to the architecture of the **Node**, through a **websocket**, communication will be made between the server and the frontend in real time;

## Backend

### Configuration

  - Configuration **Express** , a microframework that deals with routes, requests and responses;
- Configuration **nodemon** to monitor code changes and restart the server automatically when changes occur;
- Creation of *Models* and *Controllers*;
- Configuration of **mongoose** (ODM that uses Javascript syntax) to handle **MongoDB**, a nonrelational database;
